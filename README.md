# bdm-project-2

### Publications Knowledge Graph (KG)

* Considering previous preprocessing, our entities shall become our nodes/vertices, **v**, and must  contain the **id** column
* The relationships defined by PK/FK shall be our edges, **e**, and must contain the **src** and **dst** columns
* **Note:** To agree on design option for vertices and egdes as proposed in the project document


### Goal of the Project
* Build a KG representing vertices and edges
* Graph queries - Motifs (finding patterns)
* Visualization of query results
* Graph Algorithms e.g. most cited papers using page rank
